# Othello
Programming with Software Libraries (ICS 32) Class Project

Othello was a two-part final project that was assigned in my 2014 Freshman class, ICS 32 "Programming with Software Libraries" taught by professor Alex Thornton at UC Irvine.

The project was solely programmed in Python and made use of the TkInter library.  It was a completely solo project and it was prohibited to use code from any other sources.

The project first required implementing the game logic of Othello into Python, and using that logic to play a console only version through typing out commands and visualizing the board through a series of print statements.

The second part of the project was the implementation of a GUI.  This was my first experience creating a GUI and it was admittedly a challenge.  Although, I'm proud that I was one of the few who actually completed the project to its entirety whilst also avoiding any bugs.

UPDATE - KoizumiAI.cpp added:
I have also added a C++ script that I wrote for a Data Structures class a year after taking ICS 32.  The script was an AI to play in a class tournmanet which placed 18th overall against 245 other student AIs.  The class was ICS 46 "Data Structure Implementation and Analysis" also taught by Alex Thornton in my 2015 Sophomore Spring Quarter.

I've decided to add my .cpp file here because the script initially relied on a special library provided by the professor based inside a VirtualBox Machine that we used solely for the class.

CONTROLS:
Create a new game through the "New Game" button at the top left corner.
Select the game settings, which can vary anywhere from playing on a 4x4 to a 16x16 board, who starts first, and a special win condition of either obtaining the most, or the least pieces.
